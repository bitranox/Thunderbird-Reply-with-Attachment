# Reply with Attachments

## ![DE Flag](https://github.com/ashleedawg/flags/blob/master/DE.png?raw=true) [Zur deutschen Version](README_DE.md)

**Reply with Attachments** is a Thunderbird add-on that automatically includes attachments from the original email when replying to a message. Additionally, SMIME certificates are excluded from being attached.

## Features

- Automatically attaches files from the original email when replying.
- Skips SMIME certificates to avoid unnecessary attachments.

2. Download the latest version of the add-on as a ZIP file (`reply-with-attachments-plugin.zip`).

### Step 2: Install in Thunderbird
1. Open Thunderbird.
2. Navigate to **Tools > Add-ons and Themes**.
3. In the **Add-ons Manager**, click on the gear icon in the top-right corner.

---

## Compatibility

- **Tested with Thunderbird Nebula 128.6.0esr (64-Bit).**
- **Older Thunderbird versions are not supported.**

---

## Future Plans

I intend to apply to Mozilla to include this add-on in the official Mozilla Add-ons repository. Once approved, users will be able to install the add-on directly from Thunderbird's Add-ons Manager.

---

## Troubleshooting

- If the add-on does not work as expected, ensure that you are using a compatible version of Thunderbird (128.6.0esr or later).
- Check the Thunderbird error console (**Tools > Developer Tools > Error Console**) for any issues related to the add-on.
